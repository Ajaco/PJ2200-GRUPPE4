        Do you like to play video games? Are you serious about designing video games? If so, you've come to the right place. <br/><br/>

        Not only will you get to design and build your dream game but we'll host your team in well equipped computer labs and you'll also receive funding and mentor support to help make it happen. 
        <br/><br/>
        Every year between June and August, students form teams of five and compete over 10 weeks to design a fully functioning video game prototype. At the end of 10 weeks, all the teams will gather at Dare Protoplay to showcase their work and be judged by industry experts. Dare Protoplay represents the most innovative design from emerging games artists and programmers and is open to the public to come and play the games.
