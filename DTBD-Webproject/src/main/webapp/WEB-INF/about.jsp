        This is the website for the Nordic selection event for the international games development competition Dare to be Digital. The best Nordic team get to go to Scotland for the summer and set their game idea into life!<br/><br/>

        Dare to be Digital (or Dare as it is commonly known) is the premier video games development competition for University students and recent graduates and the only route to a BAFTA Ones To Watch Award.<br/><br/>

        Teams of programming and arts students from Universities and Art Colleges across the globe gather at Abertay University in Dundee, Scotland for 9 weeks during the summer break to develop their own video game. They get mentoring from games industry staff who visit throughout the competition, free accommodation in Abertay University's Halls of Residence, and stipend while the competition lasts.<br/><br/>

        At the end of the competition in August the teams head to Edinburgh, Scotland to showcase their games at an event called Dare ProtoPlay, where the general public and games industry executives will play and vote for their games. The three winning teams will each become the sole nominess for a BAFTA Ones To Watch Award.

      <p class="abouttext">
        Dare to be Digital was established by partners Scottish Enterprise Tayside, Dundee City Council and the University of Abertay Dundee in 2000, when the competition was piloted to students at Abertay. 

        <br/><br/>Dare has tried and tested many different models over the years. In 2002 Dare opened its doors to all students in Scottish Universities and Colleges of Art and was also joined for the first time by an international team, this year from Japan (in subsequent years up to 2010 we have had international teams join us from Canada, Malaysia and America).<br/><br/>
        2004 saw the start of Dare's partnership with Ireland, who have remained with the competition to this present day.
